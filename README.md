# This R package has been archived, in favor of the replacement package googlesheets4.

<https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org>

The original googlesheets package (this repo) wraps the Sheets v3 API, which is now defunct.
The deprecation process started in 2019.

The end date for the v3 API was pushed back a few times, but, as of January 2022, I'm regarding the v3 API as defunct.
The original googlesheets (no 4) package has been archived on CRAN, at my request.

The v4 Sheets API was introduced in 2016 and the [googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org) R package, which wraps the v4 API, has been available on CRAN since 2019.

If you are looking for a replacement for the googlesheets R package, you want to use [googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org) now.
